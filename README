Cognito is a prototype Web Application for democratising the way that peer-to-peer mentoring occurs in
large-scale organisations. 

Rather than only consuming mandated training in a top-down cascading fashion, Cognito offers the chance 
for ANYONE to give mentorship to ANYONE on ANY SUBJECT. By opening up staff skills in this way, it's
hoped that knowledge will flourish in large organisations (as well as significantly reducing the formal
training budgets and bloated offerings from vendors and training companies.)

The following will be fleshed out with a breakdown of the app structure in Rails 3.1 as best as possible.
